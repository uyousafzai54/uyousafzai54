# Hi, I'm Umar Yousafzai ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo and completed my first two years in Software Engineering at Waterloo. 

I have extensive experience in infrastructure and distributed systems through multiple software engineering internships. My current academic interests include security and user privacy, specifically topics in secure multi-party computation, privacy enhancing technologies and their applications to cloud computing. 

Previously, I was a Software Engineering Intern Stripe on the Service Frameworks Team and at Apple ï£¿, where I did some cool things with distributed systems and time series databases :)

In summer 2023, I completed a gap term focusing on radiogenomics research at [BHKLab](https://www.pmgenomics.ca/bhklab/), road cycling and health!

In the past, I worked at [Level Home](https://level.co) as a Software Engineering, Embedded intern and at [Carta's](https://carta.com/) Service Infrastructure Team as a Software Engineering Intern. I was also a Project Developer in [UW Blueprint](https://uwblueprint.org/) where I helped build a camp booking system for [Focus on Nature](https://github.com/carta/carta-grpc-python/blob/master/carta/grpc/interceptor/server/logging.py#L81). 

In the past I have also worked as a Full Stack Developer for the [Flight Deck](https://www.theflightdeck.ca/) in RCAF's Aerospace Warfare Centre (RWAC) and as a summer research student at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.
