# Hi, I'm Umar Yousafzai ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm currently working at [Carta's](https://carta.com/) Service Infrastructure Team as a Software Engineering Intern. I am also a Project Developer in [UW Blueprint](https://uwblueprint.org/) where I'm building a camp booking system for [Focus on Nature](https://github.com/carta/carta-grpc-python/blob/master/carta/grpc/interceptor/server/logging.py#L81). 

Previously, I worked as a Full Stack Developer for the [Flight Deck](https://www.theflightdeck.ca/) in RCAF's Aerospace Warfare Centre (RWAC) where I created v5 of [COVID CTRL](http://covid.theflightdeck.ca/), a COVID-19 risk assessment tool used throughout the RCAF. I have also worked as a summer student at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre where I researched deformable image registrations in RayStation for online adaptive radiotherapy in liver cancer patients.
